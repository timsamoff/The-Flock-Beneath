# The Flock Beneath
A simple sheepherding game.

**Contact:** samoff@gmail.com
## Description
### Inspired by a dream of the following poem:
Cloudherding seems

So much more fun

Than shepherding.

But if I don't work,

We may not eat.
## Instructions
1. Use the mouse to corral your stubborn sheep.
2. Don't let them wander out of the meadow.
3. Cloudy days can be tough.
